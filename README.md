We present data extraction system using a deep learning based natural language processing (NLP), and then extracts underlying data from the scientifi
paper using Bag-of-Words algorithm. To evaluate our algorithm accuracy based on our dataset from the main database conferences (e.g. VLDB, SIGMOD, ICDE. In addition, to evaluate data extraction performance, we conducted a user study, comparing extraction with mnually expert and our algorithm. We found that our solution identify
a right database cost model Specifically, the idea underlying this research activity is to combine NLP and the classification of features as categories of parameters forming
the context of the discussed cost model and defining a process that, moving from NP documents, instanciantes our feature diagram expressing variability along the different
CMs context.
