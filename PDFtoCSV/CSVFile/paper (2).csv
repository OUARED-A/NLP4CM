Update on parametric cost models for space telescopes
"Parametric cost models are used to plan missions, compare concepts and justify technology investments.  This paper"
updates an on-going effort to develop cost modes for space telescopes and summarizes how recent database changes
"have changed previously published preliminary results.  While the models are evolving, the previously published"
findings are valid:  telescope cost increases with aperture diameter; it costs less per square meter of collecting aperture to
build a large telescope than a small telescope; lower areal density telescopes cost more than more massive telescopes.
"Keywords: Space Telescope Cost Model, Parametric Cost Model"
Parametric cost models for space telescopes provide several benefits to designers and space system project managers.
They identify major architectural cost drivers and allow high-level design trades.  They enable cost-benefit analysis for
"technology development investment.  And, they provide a basis for estimating total project cost.  A survey of historical"
"models found that there was no definitive space telescope cost model [1]. Thus, there is a need for parametric space"
telescopes cost models.  An effort is underway to develop single variable [2] and multi-variable [3] parametric space
telescope cost models based on the latest available data and applying rigorous analytical techniques.
"After the single and multi-variable parametric models were published, the data base underwent an independent review."
"The result of that review found several data points to be incorrect.  As a result, the data base has undergone a complete"
review:  some telescopes were removed from the analysis; data for other telescopes was revised; and new telescopes
"were added to the data base.  As a result of these changes, the cost models have changed.  But the general findings"
remain unchanged:  aperture diameter is the primary cost driver for large space telescopes; it costs less per square meter
of collecting aperture to build a large telescope than a small telescope; and it costs more per kg to build a low areal
density telescope than a massive telescope.  One significant difference is that telescope cost is approximately 10% of
total mission cost instead of 30%.
2. CHANGES TO THE DATABASE
"In Sept 2010, the NRO Cost Model Office reviewed our data base and, while they did not provide us with access to their"
"database or give us any specific data, they did identify specific missions where our databases disagreed.  In response, we"
"have systematically reviewed all missions in our database.  And, as a result, some missions have been temporarily"
"removed from the database, while others have been revised (ranging from slight to dramatic).  Additionally, during the"
past year we have added several new missions to the database.  The key to cost modeling is the data base.  And the key
to the data base is being very precise in all definitions.
Optical Telescope Assembly (OTA) is defined as the subsystem which collects electromagnetic radiation and focuses it
"(focal) or concentrates it (afocal) into the science instruments.  An OTA consists of the primary mirror, secondary"
"mirror, auxiliary optics and support structure (such as optical bench or truss structure, primary support structure,"
"secondary support structure or spiders, mechanisms for adjusting the optical components, straylight baffles, etc.).  An"
OTA does not include science instruments or spacecraft subsystems.  A science instrument (SI) is defined as the
"subsystem which converts electromagnetic radiation into data.  A SI includes conditioning optics (e.g. beam splitters, re-"
"imaging optics, spectral filters, dispersive elements, etc.), mechanisms, detectors, focal planes, and electronics."
Consistency with this definition is exactly the problem with the old data base.  While the cost data for large missions
"(Hubble, Kepler, JWST, etc.) were clearly for just the OTA, the cost data for the smaller missions (GALEX, IUE,"
TRACE and WIRE) were for „instruments‟ where an instrument was defined to be an integrated system consisting of an
OTA and a SI.  Removing the science instrument costs dramatically reduced the OTA cost for these missions.
"Additionally, we have chosen to exclude thermal/cryogenic control systems from the definition of an OTA.  For"
"example, the JWST OTA does not include the cost of the JWST Sunshade.  Conforming to this definition resulted in"
another change to the database.  The „old‟ IRAS and Spitzer OTA costs included the cryogenic system.  Removing these
"costs dramatically changed the old data points.  Please note, in the future, we plan to review this decision.  It does not"
"seem logical that an infrared OTA has much utility without a thermal/cryogenic control system.  And, while it is a small"
"cost element, ambient OTAs also require thermal control systems."
"OTA Cost is defined as prime contractor cost to design, build and integrate the OTA.  OTA cost includes allocated"
subsystem level management and systems engineering as well as program level costs which can be allocated to the
"subsystem.  OTA cost does include NASA labor if NASA personnel participated in these functions, as in the case of the"
"OAO telescopes.  But OTA cost does not include NASA labor if that labor is strictly insight/oversight, as in the case of"
"JWST, Hubble, Kepler, etc.  Total mission cost is defined as Phase A-D, excluding:  launch cost; costs associated with"
"NASA labor (civil servant or support contractors) for program management, technical insight/oversight; or any NASA"
"provided ground support equipment, e.g. test facilities.  Including NASA costs would add at least 10% and maybe as"
much as 33%.
"After careful review of source CADRe Documents (Cost Analysis Data Requirements), we made the following changes"
"to the database.  We increased the cost of Kepler and Wise to include program management, systems engineering and"
"integration and test cost.  We decreased the cost of GALEX, HiRISE, HUT, OAO-3, UIT, WIRE, and WUPPE to"
remove science instrument costs.  We decreased the cost of IRAS and Spitzer by separating cryostat and OTA cost.  We
decreased the cost of SOFIA by removing the cost of the gimbal structure which holds the SOFIA OTA in the 747
"airframe.  We added cost data for the CloudSAT, OAO-B/GEP, Herschel and Planck missions.  Finally, we reduced the"
"cost of both Hubble OTA and Total Missions costs (Table 1).  Previously, we had excluded the cost of the fine guidance"
"sensor (FGS) from the OTA cost, because we believe that this cost should be allocated to the spacecraft.  But we had not"
"properly excluded management and systems engineering costs allocated to the FGS.  Also, our previous Total Mission"
cost probably included Phase E operations costs.

4. SINGLE VARIABLE MODEL
Single variable models are created by regressing OTA cost data versus parameters which are selected based on their
correlation with OTA cost (Figure 2).  Each regression is then evaluated for its „Goodness of Fit‟ and „Significance‟ via
2
"a range of statistical measures, including Pearson‟s r  coefficient, Student T-Test p-value and standard percent error"
2 2
"(SPE).  Pearson‟s r  (typically denoted as just r ) describes the percentage of agreement between the model and the"
2 2
"actual cost.  For multi-variable models, we use Adjusted Pearson‟s r  (or r adj) which accounts for the number of data"
2 2
"points and the number of variables.  In general, the closer r  (or r adj) is to 1.0 or 100%, the better the model.  SPE is a"
"normalized standard deviation of the fit residual (difference between data and fit) to the fit.  The closer SPE is to 0, the"
"better the fit.  Please note that since SPE is normalized, a small variation divided by a very small parameter coefficient"
can yield a very large SPE.  The p-value is the probability that a fit or correlation would occur if the variables are
"independent of each other.  The closer the p-value is to 0, the more significant the fit or correlation.  The closer it is to 1,"
"the less significant.  If the p-value for a given variable is small, then removing it from the model would cause a large"
"change to the model.  If it is large, then removing the variable will have a negligible effect.  Also, it is important to"
"consider how many data points are included in a given correlation, fit or regression."
"For the 8.1.11 database, the variables which yield a significant regression for OTA cost are:  aperture diameter, primary"
"mirror focal length, OTA volume, pointing stability and OTA mass.  Of these, OTA mass has the smallest SPE.  While"
"this author does not agree, many cost models only use mass to estimate cost.  Therefore, we will investigate a mass"
"model in Section 4.2.  All of the other variables are correlated with aperture.All OTAs tend to have similar F/#s.  Thus,"
"larger apertures have longer focal lengths and of course larger volumes.  Also, pointing stability is proportional to"
"resolution which is defined by aperture diameter.  Therefore, in Section 4.1 we will investigate aperture models."
4.1 Single Variable Aperture Model
This section presents aperture model results for the revised database without comparison to the previous results.  While
"the exponent of the model has changed, none of the previous conclusions have changed.  From an engineering and a"
"scientific perspective, aperture is the best parameter with which to build a space telescope cost model.  Aperture defines"
the observatory‟s science performance (sensitivity and resolution) and determines the payload‟s size and mass.  Since the
2
"aperture exponent is still less than 2, cost increases with Aperture at a rate less than D .  Thus larger telescopes cost less"
"per area than smaller telescopes.  As shown in Figure 3, for 15 free-flyer missions (excluding WIRE), we obtain the"
following cost estimating relationship (CER):
1.4 2
OTA Cost ~ Diameter (N = 15; r  = 82%; SPE = 123)
"This model based only on aperture diameter accounts for 82% of the cost variation in the real data, but it is noisy."
"As with the previous publications, we are regressing OTA cost verses aperture diameter for only free flying missions."
"Attached missions continue to have a cost relationship whose slope is parallel to the free flyer cost slope, but whose"
"leading coefficient is lower.  The implication is that attached missions, which are more massive than free flying"
"missions, are lower cost.  Changes in the database uniformly reduced the cost of small aperture missions, including the"
"attached.  Additionally, given doubt about the accuracy of WIRE, we are excluding it from the regression."
"One concern about cost versus diameter is that JWST drives the fit.  As a simple sanity check, the data was normalized"
by collecting area to define Areal Cost (cost per square meter) (Figure 4).  We have extended this previous analysis to
"include ground telescopes, and the result is the same.  Larger aperture telescopes cost less per square meter than smaller"
"aperture telescopes.  Given that the number of collected photons is proportional to collecting area, larger aperture"
telescopes have a greater return on investment (ROI) than smaller aperture telescopes.
"Finally, a regression of mission total cost versus aperture diameter yields a CER of:"
1 2
Total Cost ~ Diameter (N = 18; r  = 89%; SPE = 79)
The most interesting result of this regression is that the exponent is 1.  Total mission cost as a function of aperture
diameter is „flatter‟ than OTA cost.  The implication is that for smaller aperture missions other costs (maybe spacecraft)
dominate the mission cost.This is consistent with the earlier finding that OTA cost is only 10% of total mission cost.
4.2 Single Variable Mass Model
This section presents mass model results for the revised database without comparison to the previous results.  While the
"exponent of the model has changed, none of the previous conclusions have changed.  Although an aperture based CER is"
"logical for an optical engineer, many believe that Mass is the more important CER.  Total system mass determines what"
"vehicle can be used to launch the mission.  And, significant engineering costs are expended to keep a given payload"
"inside of its allocated mass budget, for example: light-weighting mirrors and structure.  It is factual to assert that space"
"telescopes are designed to meet a specific mass budget.  As shown in Figure 5, for 13 free-flyer mission (excluding"
"attached OTAs), we obtain the following CER:"
1.1 2
OTA Cost ~ OTA Mass (N = 13; r  = 87%; SPE = 58%)
"The mass model accounts for 87% of the variation in the real data.  And, it is less noisy than the aperture model."
A very interesting tool for analyzing the role of mass on cost is cost density (cost per kg).  Figure 6 plots OTA cost per
kg versus OTA aperture diameter.  Several obvious conclusions can be drawn from Figure 6.  All free flying space
"telescopes have approximately the same cost per kg – independent of aperture diameter.  And, all ground telescopes also"
have approximately the same cost per kg – independent of aperture diameter.  Space telescopes cost about 1000X per kg
"more than ground telescopes – independent of aperture diameter.  Additionally, UIT, WUPPE and HIT which flew"
"„attached‟ to the space shuttle are 2X less expensive per kg.  And, SOFIA which flies attached to a 747 is 15X less"
expensive.  One explanation for this data might be that each of these mission „types‟ are built to different design rules.
"While all three types need similar wavefront shape and pointing stabilities as a function of aperture diameter, they have"
"different static gravity and dynamic jitter environments.  And, they have different mass budgets with which to achieve"
the required wavefront shape and pointing stability.
Another wavelength story is Herschel and Kepler (Figure 5).  Herschel and Kepler have essentially the same mass and
"cost, but vastly different apertures, diffraction limits and operating temperatures.  Based only on aperture, Herschel"
"should be more expensive than Kepler, but it has a significantly longer diffraction limit and lower operating temperature."
A final caution about using mass as a CER can be found by considering HST vs JWST (Figure 7).  When considering
"OTA mass, HST and JWST OTAs have similar mass and thus should have similar cost, but JWST‟s OTA is 2X more"
"expensive than HST.  And, when considering total mission mass, HST‟s mass is 2X greater than JWST‟s mass.  Thus,"
"from purely a mass model, HST should cost 2X more than JWST.  But in fact JWST is 2X more than HST.  The reason"
is complexity.  JWST is more complex than HST.
"Again, the problem with using mass as a CER for space telescopes is that it is not an independent parameter.  It depends"
"on aperture diameter.  The bigger the aperture, the more massive the telescope must be to support the mirror, to achieve"
"the required pointing stability, etc.  Also, bigger aperture telescopes typically have bigger science instruments, require"
more power and have bigger spacecraft.
5. MULTI-VARIABLE MODELS
Given that the single variable aperture model accounts for only 82% of the actual OTA cost variation and is somewhat
"noisy, it is necessary to look at multi-variable models.  To develop a multi-variable model, we regress the data for"
diameter and candidate second variables (Figure 8).  A good two variable model is one where the second variable is not
"collinear with aperture diameter (this excludes OTA mass, Primary Mirror Focal Length and OTA Volume); and, where"
the addition of a second variable is significant and does not make the aperture variable insignificant.  The variables
"which meet these two conditions are:  Area Density, Spectral Minimum, Diffraction Limit and Design Life.  Of these,"
2
the two variable model with the highest adjusted r  and the lowest SPE is Diffraction Limited Wavelength:
1.5 -0.2 2
OTA Cost ~ OTA Diameter  λ   (N = 12; r  = 98%; SPE = 60%)
It is interesting to note that the Diameter exponent is slightly larger than for the single variable model.  This is because
"for our data set, the larger aperture missions are longer wavelength missions.  Thus, the cost increase for a larger"
aperture is compensated by a cost decrease for a longer diffraction wavelength.  The -0.2 exponent on wavelength
predicts that a 10X longer wavelength OTA costs 40% less.
"This two-variable model is different from our previously published two-variable model.  Previously, we had not found a"
"wavelength dependency.  And, previously, we had found a year of development dependency.  We continue to investigate"
"",,,,,,rd

"Additionally,",,we are,,finding,that,operating

6. CONCLUSIONS,
Parametric cost models for space telescopes provide several benefits to designers and space system project managers.,
They identify major architectural cost drivers and allow high-level design trades.  They enable cost-benefit analysis for,
"technology development investment. And, they provide a basis for",estimating total project cost. Based on an
"independent review of our database, we undertook a one year careful review and reconciliation of our database with",
"source documents.  As a result, there have been changes to our previously published models.  But our general findings",
remain unchanged:  aperture diameter is the primary cost driver for large space telescopes; it costs less per square meter,
of collecting aperture to build a large telescope than a small telescope; and it costs more per kg to build a low areal,
density telescope than a massive telescope.  One significant difference is that telescope cost is approximately 10% of,
total mission cost instead of 30%.,
This paper reports three OTA Cost Models:,
"",1.4 2
OTA Cost ~ Diameter,(N = 15; r  = 82%; SPE = 123)
"",1.5 -0.2 2
OTA Cost ~ OTA Diameter,λ (N = 12; r  = 98%; SPE = 60%)
"",1.1 2
OTA Cost ~ OTA Mass,(N = 13; r  = 87%; SPE = 58%)
"Of these, the diameter and wavelength model is probably the most correct.  But, it is still a work in progress."
"Finally, we continue to find that telescopes designed to a larger mass budget have a lower cost.  Space telescopes cost"
"about 1000X per kg more than ground telescopes – independent of aperture diameter.  Additionally, UIT, WUPPE and"
"HIT which flew „attached‟ to the space shuttle are 2X less expensive per kg.  And, SOFIA which flies attached to a 747"
is 15X less expensive.  One explanation might be that it requires significantly more „engineering‟ effort to design a low
areal density telescope with the required wavefront shape and pointing stability for its operational (static gravity load and
dynamic jitter) environment than it does for a high areal density telescope.
